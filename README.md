Hello everyone!
This is a simple ***AI and ML project*** created by me as part of the ***AICTE internship***.

This is a ***Lyrics-based Music Recommendation System***. It recommends songs based on the words and content of their lyrics

Vist the Music_recommendation.ipynb file to see it working!

I used a data set form Kaggle Data Set
DataSet Link:-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset/data

My GitHub link for the dataset:-https://github.com/801PEC/dataset-for-music-recommendation

Its a simple data set and contains only 4 columns.

I have mostly given comments to run it for yourself

***Important*** `(Please Read)`

I have made it so that , it downloads the data set from my github repo
so you dont have to login with your kaggle id.

The ML model will work until the recommandation of the song as list....

But the code blocks after that , consisting of the Web API will only run if you give the api key for spotify which you can get it form the ***spotifiy developers*** website and also ***ngrok api key*** should also be genrated and given For the website or web app to work!
